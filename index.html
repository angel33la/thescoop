        <p>But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I
          will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the
          truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it
          is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that
          are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself,
          because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some
          great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to
          obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure
          that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure? On the other
          hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms
          of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee</p>

        <p>One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a
          horrible
          vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly,
          slightly domed
          and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide
          off any
          moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he
          looked.
          "What's happened to me?" he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human room although a little too
          small, lay
          peacefully between its four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table -
          Samsa was a
          travelling salesman - and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated
          magazine and
          housed in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright,
          raising a heavy
          fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer. Gregor</p>

        <p>A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings of spring which I
          enjoy with my
          whole heart. I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was created for the bliss of
          souls like
          mine. I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence, that I
          neglect my
          talents. I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment; and yet I feel that I never
          was a
          greater artist than now. When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the meridian sun
          strikes the
          upper surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner
          sanctuary, I
          throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling stream; and, as I lie close to the earth, a thousand
          unknown
          plants are noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of the little world among the stalks, and grow familiar with
          the
          countless indescribable forms of the insects and flies, then I feel the presence of the Almighty, who formed
          us in his
          own image, and the breath</p>

        <p>Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind
          texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A
          small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a
          paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth. Even the all-powerful Pointing
          has no control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind
          text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar. The Big Oxmox advised her not
          to do so, because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little
          Blind Text didn’t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and made herself on the
          way. When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view back on the skyline of her
          hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane.
          Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek, then</p>
